        <li>  APOLOGIES for SOME grammer mistakes </li>
        <p>  Year 2019, the day that o/l result's released.  I could say the day of my second birth..
           <br><br>
            Sri lanka education system  will teach you how to think like a Paleolithic  man . 
            And it’ll kill your desire and curiosity very systematic and romantic way.
            <br><br><br>
            I really don’t like to go to school so I suspend education like a real sri Lankan leftist.
            Because of these reasons I failed GCE o/l math’s and ICT . but my some of friends(?) did pass.
            <br> 
            Somehow time flies .,  I bought mobile phone, very randomly and traumatically I got vitiligo skin disease. i stuck at home,  luckily I addicted to watch YouTube  . 
            Very random, probabilistic and traumatic events fraction of a second. And I spent time on YouTube, thanks to YouTube I see the world that I’ve never seen in my life before ... again randomly (?) I met person called deepthi on YouTube. Post failed o/l era is caused me to rebirth but I think the real reason is encounter of a deepthi, I began to reflect on my previous life, and very radical ideological , philosophical, change happened to my life . 
            <br><br><br>
            Let’s see what’s this bullshit education system is,
            I remember I’ve been written වාර විභාගය maybe grade 8 or 9, බොහොම කඩිනමින් පේපෙරය නිමා කල මා, වට පිටාව බැලීමට එහෙ මෙහෙ හරෙන්නට වූවා,. එවිට එක් ගුරුවරියක් බැන වදුනේ මෙසේය "o/l කරනකොට පැය 5/6ක් වත් ඉදගෙන ඉන්න තියෙනවා, ඒ නිසා පේපර් ලියන්න ඕනි නෑ ඉදගෙන ඉන්නවත් පුරුදු වෙනවා!!!"
            I think that’s enough for today,
            <br><br><br>
            හැබයි අපි ගුරුදෙවිවරුන්ට සහ වැටුනු පොත්වලට වදින්න පුරුදු වුනා....
            And also when you go to school you’ve to cut your hair “sake of deceplin(?)”., I think that’s gonna damage our personality., මොකද ලමා අවදියේ ඉදලම ලමයට වැටහීමක් එනව තමාගෙ අනන්යතාවය ගැන
            And if you failed GCE o/l math you failed ol as well ,. Your learning process is officially over also your නරක ලමයෙක්  as well  ., why is this, well it’s because sri lankan don’t have such a thing as left brain and right brain…………
            Now, the dangers part is that, when student failed exam, he feel guilty and think do something bad. Parents think the exact same. So till then their healthy relationship is over.
            Now they don’t talk with parent and addict to drugs and stuff maybe go to jail., now they can’t face their parents, also cant face the society, community as well……
            <br><br>
            
            Nowadays education isn’t that  boring, stagnate shit, now it’s a decentralized, global thing.
            You can learn anything from world’s best professionals, experts, with one search in YouTube. Why anyone bother to learn stuff from josep stalin and his old ass dudes????
            <br><br>
            But we’ve problem,. The student who leave the school as failed man have no desire or curiosity. “Man without desire” as simple as that..
            Without desire and curiosity how can born experts, proffesionals, . sri lanka is a land without experts.
            <br><br>
            That student who passed the exam is like a pen drive., they’ve trained to collect data, facts they biased on facts.
            ඔවුන් මතක තියාගන්න ගිරව් මිසක අශාවේ කෙලවරකටම ගිය විප්ලවවාදින් නොවේ
            …the education must be based ආශාව මත මිස උන්නතිකාමය මත නොවේ
            <br><br><br>
            The best thing thatever happened to me is encounter of deepthi,and see world , and I failed in sri lanka education system.
            I glad that I failed……. </p>

          But learning is all about desire, passion, curiosity.. if you find your thing, the thing
					that make you happy and impress when you doing it.., well then you don't have any reason's to complain 
					about education system, country economy, society and stuff

					google, literally harvard, one of the best university in the world put theire courses online FOR FREE. how 
					sick is that though......
